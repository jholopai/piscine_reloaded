# piscine_reloaded

A set of exercises to go through some of the basics of C.

These are mostly not the solutions I made when I first started with C, but rather ones that I have re-done now that I have a few months of studies under my belt.

## Considerations
- In this project we didn't use a header file. All sub-functions are prototyped on the files they are used in
- Only library functions specified in the exercise are allowed
